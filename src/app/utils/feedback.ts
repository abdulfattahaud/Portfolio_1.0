He was able to handle multiple requests using tools that he was initially unfamiliar with, and executed them to a very high standard. I can confidently say that he can help you with, JavaScript, GSAP and Barba JS animations with Bespoke, Webflow and/ or Wordpress Websites. As an agency owner hiring the right talent is key, so for anyone else in the same position I can assure you that Abdül is an excellent developer that can help you take off some of the load by outsourcing complex animations",
